# SDD Phase — Common Protocol

Boilerplate identical across all SDD phase skills. Sub-agents MUST load this alongside their phase-specific SKILL.md.

Executor boundary: every SDD phase agent is an EXECUTOR, not an orchestrator. Do the phase work yourself. Do NOT launch sub-agents, do NOT call `delegate`/`task`, and do NOT bounce work back unless the phase skill explicitly says to stop and report a blocker.

## A. Skill Loading

1. Check if the orchestrator injected a `## Skills to load before work` block in your launch prompt. If yes, read those exact `SKILL.md` files before task-specific work.
2. If no skills block was provided, check for `SKILL: Load` instructions. If present, load those exact skill files.
3. If neither was provided, search for the skill registry as a fallback:
   a. `mem_search(query: "skill-registry", project: "{project}")` — if found, `mem_get_observation(id)` for full content
   b. Fallback: read `.atl/skill-registry.md` from the project root if it exists
   c. From the registry's skills index, match triggers to your task and read the exact listed `SKILL.md` paths.
4. If no registry exists, proceed with your phase skill only.

NOTE: the preferred path is (1) — exact skill paths selected by the orchestrator. Paths (2) and (3) are fallbacks. Searching the registry is SKILL LOADING, not delegation. If `## Skills to load before work` is present, IGNORE redundant `SKILL: Load` instructions.

## B. Artifact Retrieval (Engram Mode)

**CRITICAL**: `mem_search` returns 300-char PREVIEWS, not full content. You MUST call `mem_get_observation(id)` for EVERY artifact. **Skipping this produces wrong output.**

**Run all searches in parallel** — do NOT search sequentially.

```
mem_search(query: "sdd/{change-name}/{artifact-type}", project: "{project}") → save ID
```

Then **run all retrievals in parallel**:

```
mem_get_observation(id: {saved_id}) → full content (REQUIRED)
```

Do NOT use search previews as source material.

## C. Artifact Persistence

Every phase that produces an artifact MUST persist it. Skipping this BREAKS the pipeline — downstream phases will not find your output.

For `verify-report`, first build exact candidate bytes and run `gentle-ai sdd-verify-validate` with authoritative requirement/scenario counts before any OpenSpec or Engram write. If the validator is unavailable or denies admission, make zero writes and leave the prior report untouched; otherwise persist only the same admitted bytes, including a valid `fail`.

### Engram mode

```
mem_save(
  title: "sdd/{change-name}/{artifact-type}",
  topic_key: "sdd/{change-name}/{artifact-type}",
  type: "architecture",
  project: "{project}",
  capture_prompt: false,
  content: "{your full artifact markdown}"
)
```

`topic_key` enables upserts — saving again updates, not duplicates.
`capture_prompt: false` is mandatory for SDD artifacts because they are automated pipeline outputs, not human/proactive memory saves. Set it when the Engram tool schema supports it; if an older schema rejects or does not expose the field, omit it rather than failing.

### OpenSpec mode

File was already written during the phase's main step. No additional action needed.

### Hybrid mode

Do BOTH: write the file to the filesystem AND call `mem_save` as above.

### None mode

Return result inline only. Do not write any files or call `mem_save`.

## D. Return Envelope

> **CRITICAL — Response ordering**: Your FINAL output MUST be text (the return envelope), NOT a tool call. If you need to save to Engram (`mem_save`), do it BEFORE your final text response. Do NOT call `mem_session_summary` — that's for top-level agents only. **Why**: When a sub-agent's last action is a tool call, the parent agent receives only the tool result — your text response (the actual analysis) is lost.

Every phase MUST return a structured envelope to the orchestrator:

- `status`: `success`, `partial`, or `blocked`
- `executive_summary`: 1-3 sentence summary of what was done
- `detailed_report`: (optional) full phase output, or omit if already inline
- `artifacts`: list of artifact keys/paths written
- `next_recommended`: the next SDD phase to run, or "none"
- `risks`: risks discovered, or "None"
- `skill_resolution`: how skills were loaded — `paths-injected` (received exact skill paths from orchestrator), `fallback-registry` (self-loaded paths from registry), `fallback-path` (loaded via SKILL: Load path), or `none` (no skills loaded)

Example:

```markdown
**Status**: success
**Summary**: Proposal created for `{change-name}`. Defined scope, approach, and rollback plan.
**Artifacts**: Engram `sdd/{change-name}/proposal` | `openspec/changes/{change-name}/proposal.md`
**Next**: sdd-spec or sdd-design
**Risks**: None
**Skill Resolution**: paths-injected — 3 skills (react-19, typescript, tailwind-4)
(other values: `fallback-registry`, `fallback-path`, or `none — no registry found`)
```

## E. Review Workload Guard

SDD must protect reviewer cognitive load, not only generate tasks.

- The default PR review budget is **400 changed lines** (`additions + deletions`).
- Count authored text additions plus deletions only for this threshold. Generated goldens are excluded from authored risk count but remain included in complete snapshot identity and receipt validation.
- The orchestrator MUST cache a delivery strategy at session start: `ask-on-risk` (default), `auto-chain`, `single-pr`, or `exception-ok`. Those four are the whole domain.
- Any other `delivery_strategy` value is invalid. A phase MUST NOT map it to the nearest branch, MUST NOT record it in an artifact, and MUST NOT forward it: report the unrecognised value and stop.
- The orchestrator MUST pass `delivery_strategy` to `sdd-tasks` and the resolved decision to `sdd-apply`.
- `sdd-tasks` MUST forecast whether the planned work may exceed that budget.
- The forecast MUST include exact plain-text guard lines: `Decision needed before apply: Yes|No`, `Chained PRs recommended: Yes|No`, and `400-line budget risk: Low|Medium|High`.
- If the forecast is high, `sdd-tasks` MUST recommend chained or stacked PRs using deliverable work units.
- `sdd-apply` MUST NOT start oversized work unless the delivery strategy resolves to chained/stacked PR slices or explicitly accepted `size:exception`.
- Each chained PR slice must have a clear start, clear finish, autonomous scope, verification, and reasonable rollback.
- In a Feature Branch Chain, PR #1 targets the feature/tracker branch and later child PRs target the immediate previous PR branch; if GitHub shows previous slices in a child diff, retarget/rebase until the diff is clean.

This guard exists to reduce reviewer burnout and keep implementation delivery safe. Do not treat it as optional process noise.

## F. Key Learnings Closing

Close your **final report message** (the return envelope) with a `## Key Learnings` section to enable engram passive capture.

**Format**: numbered list with 1–5 items. Each item is a standalone factual sentence that is ≥20 characters and ≥4 words.

**Example**:

```markdown
## Key Learnings

1. Async validation in the apply phase caught a race condition in concurrent writes.
2. Golden test regeneration for system prompts requires the `-update` flag before re-run.
3. Bounded review contracts must stay consistent across `sdd-phase-common.md` and `engram/protocol.md`.
```

This applies to your final text response to the orchestrator, not intermediate tool outputs or artifact content. Engram will automatically extract and persist these learnings.
