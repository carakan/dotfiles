> **ORCHESTRATOR GATE**: If you loaded this skill via the `skill()` tool, you are

## Executor Override

If you ARE the `sdd-init` sub-agent (NOT the orchestrator), the gate above does NOT apply to you. Continue with the phase work below. Do NOT delegate. Do NOT call the Skill tool. You are the executor — execute.

## Language Domain Contract

Generated technical artifacts default to English. Do not inherit the user's conversational language or the active persona's regional voice for SDD artifacts unless the user explicitly requests that artifact language or the project convention requires it.

If technical artifacts are explicitly requested in another language, use a neutral/professional register unless the user explicitly requests a different tone or regional variant.

Public/contextual comments follow the target context language by default. Explicit user language or tone overrides win; otherwise use a neutral/professional register unless the target context clearly calls for another tone or regional variant.

## Activation Contract

Run this phase when the orchestrator/user asks to initialize SDD in a project. You are the phase executor: do the work yourself, do not delegate, and do not behave like the orchestrator.

## Hard Rules

- Detect the real stack, conventions, architecture, testing tools, and persistence mode; never guess.
- In `engram` mode, do **not** create `openspec/`.
- In `openspec` mode, follow `../_shared/openspec-convention.md` and write file artifacts.
- In `hybrid` mode, write both openspec files and Engram observations.
- Always persist testing capabilities separately as `sdd/{project}/testing-capabilities` or `openspec/config.yaml` `testing:`.
- Always build `.atl/skill-registry.md`; also save `skill-registry` to Engram when available.
- Use `capture_prompt: false` for automated SDD/config saves when supported; omit it if the tool schema lacks it.
- If `openspec/` already exists, report what exists and ask before updating it.

## Decision Gates

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| `mode=engram` | Save context and capabilities to Engram only. |
| `mode=openspec` | Create/update openspec bootstrap files only. |
| `mode=hybrid` | Do both Engram and openspec persistence. |
| `mode=none` | Return detected context only; write no SDD artifacts except registry if required. |
| strict TDD marker/config found | Use that value. |
| no marker/config but test runner exists | Default `strict_tdd: true`. |
| no test runner | Set `strict_tdd: false` and explain unavailable. |

## Execution Steps

1. Inspect project files (`package.json`, `go.mod`, `pyproject.toml`, CI, lint/test config) and summarize stack/conventions.
2. Detect test runner, test layers, coverage, linter, type checker, and formatter.
3. Resolve Strict TDD from agent marker, `openspec/config.yaml`, detected runner fallback, or no-runner fallback.
4. Initialize persistence for the resolved mode.
5. Build `.atl/skill-registry.md` using the skill-registry scan rules.
6. Persist testing capabilities and project context.
7. Return the structured initialization envelope.

## Output Contract

Return `status`, `executive_summary`, `artifacts`, `next_recommended`, and `risks`. Include project, stack, persistence mode, Strict TDD status, testing capability table, saved observation IDs/paths, registry path, and next `/sdd-explore` or `/sdd-new` step.
